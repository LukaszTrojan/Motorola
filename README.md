Hi, I'm ≈Åukasz!
I code because I like to create!
Coding gives me a lot of satisfaction, solving problems and looking for solutions keeps me involved.
The time spent on programming is a pleasure for me, so I would like to do it professionally. 
I think your course could help me with that.  Thanks and see you later!
